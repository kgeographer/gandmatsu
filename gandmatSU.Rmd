## Geography

#### AMSTUD 124A: The American West (ARTHIST 152, ENGLISH 124, HISTORY 151, POLISCI 124A)
The American West is characterized by frontier mythology, vast distances, marked aridity, and unique political and economic characteristics. This course integrates several disciplinary perspectives into a comprehensive examination of Western North America: its history, physical geography, climate, literature, art, film, institutions, politics, demography, economy, and continuing policy challenges. Students examine themes fundamental to understanding the region: time, space, water, peoples, and boom and bust cycles.

#### AMSTUD 268C: Poverty in America (CSRE 268C, HISTORY 268C, HISTORY 368C)
During the twentieth century, Americans launched numerous bold efforts to reduce poverty in the United States. Federal welfare policy, community-based programs, academic research, philanthropic charity, and grassroots activism committed time and resources to the cause, but poverty-- and inequality-- have persisted. Why? This seminar considers the origins, implementation, and consequences of these remedies, noting in particular how race, gender, citizenship, family composition, and geography have shaped the lives of those in poverty and the public and private responses to it.

Instructors: Dunning, C. (PI)

#### ANTHRO 39: Sense of Place
This course examines the life of places as shaped by environmental events and projects aimed towards rural or urban development. Drawing methodological insights from anthropology, cultural geography and environmental studies, we examine the forces that generate place problems for humans and nonhumans. Each encounter with place and displacement sets up a particular issue for us to grapple with: How would we address issues created by natural disasters, the seizure of land through legal means that fall under eminent domain or gentrification projects? Through a critical dialogue with interdisciplinary fields that inform the readings, the seminar aims to bring theoretical and methodological insights to inform our practical suggestions for how to address placeness and displaceness at different scales.
Terms: Aut | Units: 3 | Grading: Letter (ABCD/NP)
Instructors: Ebron, P. (PI)

#### ANTHRO 42: Megacities
In this course we will examine the meaning, processes, and challenges of urbanization. Through a series of targeted readings across history and geography and through the study of varied means of representation (anthropology, literature, cartography, film, etc), the class will analyze the ways in which urban forms have come into being and created, met, and/or ignored challenges such as disease, water, transport, religious and class conflict, colonialism, labor, and trade. Students will read anthropology in conjunction with other disciplines (literature, urban planning, public health, architecture, and economics) to learn the ways in which ethnographies of immigration, urban poverty, class disparity, economic development and indicators, noise, and transportation substantively augment our understandings of how people live within globalization.

#### ARTSINST 182: Activating Urban Spaces: Materializing Hidden Narratives in the Urban Environment (URBANST 182)
This course will investigate the organization and shaping of public space from the perspective of story and narrative. The course will consider how authorized narratives feature in the built environment and in the social spaces and usage of the city and how unauthorized, sometimes contentious narratives lurk beneath the surface and persist on the "skin" of the city. It will investigate the role of artists and the arts in "mapping" or surfacing alternative stories, concepts and imaginations of how the city is or can be. Inspired by the writings of Michel DeCerteau and Italo Calvino, this class explores the role of narrative in the city and the imagination from the perspective of cultural memory, lived experience, usage of space and organization of the built infrastructure. It offers an alternative approach to thinking about cities, how they are formed and how they function. This class will utilize and combine active field research methods with creative practice. Locations for our field research and excursions will include areas around Stanford and the Bay Area. The class will function as a hybrid seminar and collaborative studio workspace supporting students interested in applying creative practices to field research to develop methods for materializing narratives in various forms of public performance or place-specific art. Students will develop research for projects tailored to a particular location of their choosing and will explore the idea of the 'hidden city' its histories and its communities.

#### CEE 32Q: Place: Making Space Now
This seminar argues that architeccts are ultimately "placemakers," and questions what that means in the contemporary world. Part I investigates the meaning of the word "place." Additional background for understanding contemporary place making will include a critique of the history of modern place-making through an examination of modern form. Part II examines two traditional notions of place by scale: from "home" to "the city." What elements give these conceptions of space a sense of place? To answer this question, themes such as memory, mapping, and boundary, among others, will be investigated. part III presents challenges to the traditional notions of place discussed in Part II. Topics addressed include: What does it mean to be "out of place"? What sense of place does a nomad have, and how is this represented? What are the "non-places" and how can architects design for these spaces? Part IV addresses the need to re-conceptualize contemporary space. The role of digital and cyber technologies, the construction of locality in a global world, and the in-between places that result from a world in flux are topics discussed in this section of the seminar. nLearning goals: Specific goals include clsoe reading of texts, understanding of philosophical thinking and writing, argument under uncertainty, and developed concepts of place, space and architecture.

## Spatial

#### ANTHRO 116B: Anthropology of the Environment (ANTHRO 216B)
This seminar interrogates the history of anthropology's approach to the environment, beginning with early functionalist, structuralist, and Marxist accounts of human-environment relationships. It builds towards more recent developments in the field, focusing on nonhuman and relational ontologies as well as current projects on the intersections of nature, capital, politics, and landscape histories. At the end of this class, students will be familiar with the intellectual histories of environmental anthropology and contemporary debates and tensions around questions of ethics, agency, environment, and historical causality.

#### URBANST 105: The Hipster and the City: Race, Ethnicity, Hip-Hop, and Gentrification in Oakland
This course introduces undergraduate students to the theory and methods of the geospatial approaches to urban problems like gentrification through urban storytelling, i.e.,listening to the stories that people tell about their experience in the city and interpreting these narratives with the aforementioned tools and analytical framework. nn Using social media, History pin software, Detour (Walking Tours,) and other spatial theory and technical learning methodologies including Google Street view and Tagging collectives, we will take Walking Tours through Oakland to understand gentrification. Students will select one of five areas of Oakland and interview people and record their stories. This is a course that is place-based audio storytelling with the Detour software that is used in Stanford¿s Media X department.nn As an urban storyteller, the student learns that stories are place-based. Next, the student learns how to find a Narrator, who can tell the story, and; finally, the student must discover what the story really is.nn We will meet the President of SPUR, an important lobbying organization for Oakland. We will also visit rapper and political leader, Boots Reily, and Radio DJ JR, visit with the Oakland Mayor, Libby Schaaf, and finally an interview with Crazy Kyle, who is self-described as a ¿White Negro.¿ nn Thus, the Urban Storyteller is both an observer and a participant who speaks to us about race, ethnicity, hip-hop, and gentrification in the American City, such as Oakland. The Corner is the place-based site for the intersection of oral and digital culture. But the Walking Tour is more dynamic.
